The mobile app is available on both Google Play and the Apple Store. (to put download links here)


The mobile app will allow you to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents. You can add responders and run response plays, as well as reassign incidents and add notes. With schedules, you can easily create overrides and view your upcoming on call shifts. You can customize your ringtones and set behavior for high and low urgency incidents all from your settings page.

Below is a walkthrough of our mobile app. You can download the app from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pagerduty/id594039512) for iOS or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pagerduty.android) for Android. Screenshots are from our Android app, and the iOS app is very similar.

The first time you open the PagerDuty app, you will be prompted to enter your email address/password or subdomain to login.

After logging in, you should see a similar screen as follows:
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/e0ba4d8-Screenshot_1555954193.png",
        "Screenshot_1555954193.png",
        1080,
        1920,
        "#112a33"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
The **All** tab shows all triggered and acknowledged incidents in the account.

Push notifications will look similar to the one below. You can acknowledge an incident directly from the notification. PagerDuty push notifications provide the incident number, service, and incident description.

        1080,
        1920,
        "#393841"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
If a triggered incident is assigned to you, the banner at the top will turn red. Your incidents will be under the **Mine** tab on the **Open Incidents** screen. Once you acknowledge the incident, the banner will turn yellow.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]
[Snooze](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/editing-incidents#section-snooze-an-incident) an incident by swiping left on an acknowledged incident.

Tap an incident to enter the incident detail screen. The incident detail screen contains incident info and timeline.

You also have other options such as running a response play, changing or adding priority, adding responders and more from the Incident detail page.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
 You will also see **Ack** and **Resolve** buttons when selecting a triggered incident. After an incident is acknowledged, the **Ack** button becomes a **Snooze** button.

To resolve, swipe left. You can customize your swipe actions within the Settings menu. You can still add notes even after an incident has been resolved.

You can use the mobile app to trigger, acknowledge, snooze, and reassign incidents. For more information on using the mobile app, you can check out the [mobile app walkthrough](#section-mobile-app-walkthrough).

##Trigger an Incident

To trigger an incident in the mobile app, open the app, view the **Open Incidents** screen, and tap the More icon in the upper right corner.
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/8c32148-MobileAppActions_img1.png",

        "#0f241f"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
You can optionally choose to assign an incident to an escalation policy other than the service's default escalation policy. This overrides who the incident is assigned to.

##Acknowledge or Snooze an incident
There are 2 ways to acknowledge an incident in the mobile app. On the **Open Incidents** screen:
1. Swipe **left** on an incident to acknowledge the incident.
2. Tap an incident and then **ACK** at the bottom of the screen.
[block:image]

        1334,
        "#1a2338"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Once you acknowledge the incident you will also see the option to [Snooze](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/editing-incidents#section-snooze-an-incident) the incident for a period of time.

        178,
        "#2b2e35"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
##Resolve an Incident
There are 2 ways to resolve an incident in the mobile app. On the **Open Incidents** screen:
- Swipe **right** to resolve the incident.
- Tap the name of the incident and then **RESOLVE** at the bottom of the screen.
[block:image]

        "#292d36"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
##Other Actions
You can also [add responders](/docs/adding-users-to-existing-incidents#section-add-responders), [reassign](/docs/adding-users-to-existing-incidents#section-reassign-or-delegate-an-incident), [add priority](/docs/incident-priority), and [add notes](/docs/editing-incidents#section-add-a-note-to-an-incident) to incidents in the mobile app. These option are available from the **MORE** menu at the bottom of the screen.

        750,
        1334,
        "#122920"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
##Live Updating

With live updating of incidents, incident pages and detail screens will stay up-to-date with the latest information and incident statuses, eliminating the need to manually refresh these pages in order to get updates. 

While on an incident list, when new incidents come in, a button will appear near the top of the screen indicating how many new incidents are ready to be shuffled into the list. After pressing that button, new incidents will be shuffled in and the view will move to the latest, highest priority incident. Alternatively the user can invoke a scroll, where the button will disappear and the new incidents will be shuffled in, but the view will not change.
 
Live updating is **on** by default. In order to disable Live Updating:
 
1. 	Navigate to the Settings tab of the mobile app
2. 	Under the Performance section, toggle Live Updating off
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "Note",
  "body": "While on screens with liveness, push notifications will not show up in the app as to not distract users from triaging incidents. The push notifications will still be logged in your notifications list and in the incident’s timeline."
}
[/block]
##Scheduling Overrides

To schedule an override from the mobile app, navigate to **☰ > Schedules** and select the schedule.
