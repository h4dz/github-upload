For more information about authenticating using an API key, please consult the [related documentation](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/authentication).

For more information on the differences between the APIs, check out our article on the differences between our [REST and Events APIs](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/getting-started). 

The [REST API](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/rest-api) is available to all customers on **current** [pricing plans](https://www.pagerduty.com/pricing/). It is not available to some customers on legacy pricing plans.

There are two types of REST API keys, [general access](doc:generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-general-access-rest-api-key) and [user tokens](doc:generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-personal-rest-api-key), both of which are 20-character strings. REST API keys cannot be used with the Events APIs, they can only be used for the REST API.

## Generating a General Access REST API Key

{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "You must be an admin or account owner within PagerDuty to access your API key. REST API access is only included on the [Platform Team plan](https://www.pagerduty.com/pricing/) or higher — API access is not included on the Starter plan.",
  "title": "Note"

1. Go to **Configuration → API Access** and click **Create New API Key**.
2. Enter a **Description** that will help you identify the key later on. If you would like it to be read-only, check the *Read-only* option. 
3. Click **Create Key**.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
4. A unique API key will be generated. Copy it to a safe place and click **Close**.

Once you click Close you will be asked to confirm that you copied the API key. **This is your last chance to copy the key** — you will only be able to see the last 4 characters of the key in the PagerDuty interface after you confirm. If you lose a key you will need to delete it and create a new one.

Once created, you will see your key appear in the list of keys on the API Access page, with versioning noted.

## Generating a Personal REST API Key

If your account has [Advanced Permissions](doc:advanced-permissions) enabled, users can create personal REST API keys on the **User Settings** tab of their user profile. Requests made using personal REST API keys will be restricted to the user's permissions, and if a client attempts to use the key for an operation that the user in question is not permitted to perform, the API will respond with status `403 Forbidden`.

}

The [Events APIs](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/getting-started#events-apis) are available to all customers, and any user with a manager role or above can generate an integration key. Both the Events API v1 and v2 use integration keys — formerly known as service keys — to determine which service an event should be routed to.

Integration keys are generated by [creating a new service, or creating a new integration for an existing service](doc:services-and-integrations) in PagerDuty, and can be found on a service's **Integrations** tab:
