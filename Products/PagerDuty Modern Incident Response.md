PagerDuty Modern Incident Response includes capabilities essential for every stage of the response process for critical incidents:

- [Response Mobilizer](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/mobilizing-a-response): Easily engage multiple responders for a coordinated team response to accelerate critical incident resolution. Leverage existing rotation schedules in PagerDuty to bring in team on-calls and subject matter experts. 
- [Response Plays](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/response-automation): Design the right response automation for any impact level—mobilize responders, engage stakeholders with status updates, and set up conference bridge collaboration. Response plays can be run with a single tap from the PagerDuty mobile app, within the PagerDuty web app, or even run automatically for new incidents on mission-critical services.
- [Priority-based Triage](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/incident-priority): Easily classify PagerDuty incidents with custom-defined levels that align with your organization’s priority scheme: P1 through P5, SEV1 through SEV5, etc.
- [Conference Bridge Integration](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/response-bridge): Include conference bridge details on critical incidents so that responders can tap and dial in to the response bridge.
- [Stakeholder Communication](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/communicating-with-stakeholders): Engage the entire business—IT management, support, executives, marketing, sales, legal, and more. Inform stakeholders with real-time status updates, enabling rapid organization-wide response without interrupting technical responders.

- [Postmortems](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/postmortems): A streamlined learning process for your organization to improve at resolving and preventing incidents.
