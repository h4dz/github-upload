Adding subscribers lets you notify stakeholders who aren't directly involved with resolving the incident. These could be C-level executives concerned about the health of the company, or a Support team interacting with customers during an outage, for instance.

##Subscriber Notifications
Once subscribed to an incident, stakeholders can expect to receive all subsequent manual status updates on that incident. Subscriber notifications will be sent the status update via their first email contact method and first SMS contact method, and their last push [contact method](/docs/configuring-a-user-profile#section-contact-information) in their user profile.

  "body": "We currently do not offer customized notification rules to notify on a specific channel; if you do not wish to receive updates on a certain channel we recommend leaving that contact method blank."
}
[/block]
Notification emails contain the most information about an incident:
- Who sent the notification
- Incident number and description
- When the incident was opened
- The affected service
- To whom the incident is currently assigned
- Incident status
- A link to the incident status page

2. Click on the **Subscribers** tab.
3. Under **Subscribers**, click on the name of the subscriber you want to remove.

## Adding Subscribers at Scale

For repeatable, automated engagement of stakeholders, you can make use of a **Response Play**. Response plays are packaged incident actions, and **adding subscribers** is one component. You can read further about the response plays feature [here.](/docs/response-automation)

Effectively engaging with stakeholders should enable transparent communication around the potential impact and resolution progress of an incident. Proactive stakeholder communication can reduce or eliminate stakeholder inquiries about the incident status, which allows the incident responders to focus on resolving the incident at hand. Check out [our guide](/docs/how-to-effective-stakeholder-communications) to learn more about effective stakeholder communications.

# Other Features to Facilitate Incident Response

Instead of engaging stakeholders, which aren't directly involved in resolving the incident, you can: 

* [Add Responders](/docs/mobilizing-a-response) which enables you to receive **assistance from additional users** with an incident response. 
* [Escalating or Delegating an Incident](/docs/reassigning-and-delegating-incidents) which **re-assigns** the incident resolution responsibilities to another user.
