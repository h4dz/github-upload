#PagerDuty vCard

PagerDuty phone and SMS notifications can come from varying numbers based on your country and other variables. The best way to ensure that youâ€™re receiving a notification from PagerDuty is to download the PagerDuty vCard, which is an up-to-date file that contains the numbers that PagerDuty notifications can come from. You can import the PagerDuty vCard into your address book on your computer or smartphone. We highly recommend [downloading the vCard](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pdpartner/PagerDuty+Outgoing+Numbers.vcf) and keeping it updated.
